This is highly subjective but XML appears to be the easiest file types for humans to read. It clearly labels each field and it is easy to discern which object starts where but it is also the most verbose. CSV is the most space efficient but the objects are not as clearly defined which could be problematic. JSON offers a good compromise between space efficiency and readability and, for these reasons, is likely the best format to use for computers.
